Description: Estimation and inference for standard Peak Over Threshold
    (POT) models using heterogeneous data. The results can be
    formulated in relation with either the Poisson-GP or with the
    Point-Process formulation. The classical block maxima and
    r-largest frameworks can be coped with, and moreover the data can
    in both cases be censored by discarding the observations below a
    chosen threshold.
